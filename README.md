### Notes
I had a great deal of trouble with the [Android Async HTTP] and Glide at first but now i understand at least the basics of their use. Mainly my issues stemmed from not using the debugger to step through large issues 

edit : by far the hardest thing was adding genre information

### Open-source libraries used

- [Android Async HTTP](https://github.com/loopj/android-async-http) - Simple asynchronous HTTP requests with JSON parsing
- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) - Image loading and caching library for Androids
